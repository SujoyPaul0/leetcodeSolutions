Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200

Output: 2

Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:

Play token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.
Play token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.
Play token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.
Play token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2.
The maximum score achievable is 2.
