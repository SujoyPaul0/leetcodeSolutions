Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.

            if (skill[l] + skill[r]) == tSkill:
                res.append([skill[l], skill[r]])
                l += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                return -1

        for team in res:
            chem += (team[0] * team[-1])

        return chem
