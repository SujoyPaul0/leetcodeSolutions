# LeetCode Solutions in Python 🐍

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all implemented in Python. I created this repository to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and share my solutions with others.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

- **Easy**: Solutions for problems marked as Easy difficulty.
- **Medium**: Solutions for problems marked as Medium difficulty.
- **Hard**: Solutions for problems marked as Hard difficulty.

Each file is named based on the LeetCode problem number and the problem name for easier reference.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-solutions-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder containing solutions of a specific difficulty level:
   ```bash
   cd LeetCode-Solutions/Easy
   ```

3. Open the solution file in your favorite code editor:
   ```bash
   code problem_1_two_sum.py
   ```

## 🚀 Problem-Solving Approach

For each problem, I aim to:
- Understand the problem statement thoroughly.
- Design an efficient algorithm.
- Implement the solution using Python.
- Optimize the solution for better performance if possible.

## 📈 Progress
