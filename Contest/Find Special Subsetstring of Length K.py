Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabaaa", k = 3

Output: true

Explanation:

The substring s[4..6] == "aaa" satisfies the conditions.

It has a length of 3.
All characters are the same.
The character before "aaa" is 'b', which is different from 'a'.
There is no character after "aaa".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abc", k = 2

Output: falseÂ©leetcode

            return False

        for i in range(n - k + 1):

        return False
